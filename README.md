# My Portfolio Website

---
## Description

My personal portfolio website. It is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. Itâ€™s like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. However, Why why did i choose Next.js? Because it is a React framework with Server-Side Rendering, which is good for SEO (Good for us if we get found on Google, right?).

Also, Next.js helps us build a full back-end & blazing-fast websites along with benefits such as Image optimization.

Why tailwindcss? Because TailwindCSS is a framework which reduces a lot of styling efforts. It has low level CSS classes that you can directly embed into the HTML code.
