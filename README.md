## Why Next.js?

I chose Next.js because it is a powerful React framework with Server-Side Rendering, which enhances SEO and helps us get discovered on Google. Additionally, Next.js allows us to build a full back-end and create blazing-fast websites with benefits like image optimization.

## Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS is a framework that significantly reduces styling efforts. It provides low-level CSS classes that can be directly embedded into HTML, streamlining the design process.
